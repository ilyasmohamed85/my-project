        <h2 class="fade-in">Where It All Began</h2><br>
        <p class="fade-in">Barbering is more than a cut — it’s a culture, a tradition, a craft passed down through centuries.</p><br>
    
        <div class="history-content">
            <p class="fade-in"><strong>Ancient Roots:</strong> Barbering can be traced back as far as 5000 B.C. In ancient Egypt,
                barbers used sharpened flint and seashells to groom their clients. In ancient Rome, barbershops (called <em>tonstrina</em>)
                were central hubs for news and social connection.</p><br>
    
            <p class="fade-in"><strong>Middle Ages:</strong> Barbers were known as barber-surgeons. They not only cut hair and shaved beards,
                but also performed surgeries, bloodletting, and even tooth extractions. That’s where the red and white barber pole 
                comes from — red for blood, white for bandages.</p><br>
    
            <p class="fade-in"><strong>Modern Era:</strong> By the 18th and 19th centuries, barbering evolved into a specialized grooming profession.
                In America and Europe, barbershops became cultural institutions — places to talk, relax, and stay sharp.</p><br>
    
            <p class="fade-in"><strong>Today:</strong> The modern barber blends tradition with style — offering fades, shaves, line-ups, 
                and grooming with flair and precision. It’s not just about how you look — it’s how you feel when you walk out of that chair.</p>
